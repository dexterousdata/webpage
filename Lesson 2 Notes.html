			<h1>Lesson 2.1 - "Serious Programming"</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Computer</h2>
					<p>
						A computer can be programed to do just about anything. Programmers are only limited by their imagination.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Program</h2>
					<p>
						A program is a set of instructions of things for the computer to do. i.e. 1) store in memory variable "a" to represent a value 10. <br>
						2) compute a times 5
						>>> 50
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Language</h2>
					<p>
						Simply the language that the specific program understands. Not to different to Japanese people speaking Japanese, Python has a set of syntaxes making it it's own language - Python-ese if you will =)
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Python</h2>
					<p>
						Python is an interpreter. It converts the code inputted to an output
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Grammar and expressions</h2>
					<p>
						Grammar is extreemly important that’s why syntaxes are used, you are exactly correct or not. No confusion.<br>
						<br>
						For example:<br>

						<code>
							variable = value<br>
							a = 10
						</code>

					</p>

			<h1>Lesson 2.2 - Variables and Strings</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Variable</h2>
					<p>
						In Python a variable is an item that refers to another object. Similar to math’s. <br>
						a could reference the integer 10 or a could reference the string "abc", and many other possibilities
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Assign a Variable</h2>
					<p>
						You assign a variable through the " = " sign. a = 10 translates to the symbol "a" is  now bonded to the integer value of 10. So at this point "a" and 10 have the same value.
					</p>
					<p>
						"=" when assigning a variable is different to math’s were you are stating 2 + 3 = (is equal to) 5. Assigning binds a value to a variable so a = a - 1 is one less than a's current value. In math’s this is not possible, 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Variable Uses</h2>
					<p>
						Variable's are used to add redability to code. Transforming a number or string it something easily recognizable
					</p>	
					<p>
						To note:<br>
						<code>2 + 2</code>
						and
						<code>"2" + "2"</code>
						are very different. The first is integer addition and the second is concatenation of strings
					</p>

				<h1>Lesson 2.3 - Procedures</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Functions</h2>
					<p>
						Functions or 'procedures' are sub programs within the larger program. They act to complete a task for each given input. The top program can call on a sub program at any time and give inputs. The function then provides the output the top program uses. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Making a function is creating the sub program. The internal procedures for the function. Calling the function or using it is 'running' the sub program to provide an out put that is used by the program that called it.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Avoiding Repetition</h2>
					<p>
						Functions help programmers avoid repetition by preforming a sub task for each and every given input instead of the programmer rewriting the code for each input.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>Return Statement</h2>
				<p>
					The return statement tells the sub program what to return to the program that called it. The program that called the function then will use the provided output in its code.
				</p>
			</div>

				<h1>Lesson 2.4 - Loops</h1>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>While Loops</h2>
					<p>
						While loops run while a condition is not met. i.e. while a != b or count <code>></code> inputted number
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="concept">
				<h2>For Loops</h2>
					<p>
						For loops go through element in a data structure. i.e. each element in a list or each letter in a string.
